It powers rest.wikimedia.org, the Wikimedia REST content API currently in beta production. As a proxy, RESTBase does not perform any significant content processing itself. Instead, it requests content transformations from backend services when needed, and typically (depending on configuration) stores it back for later retrieval. For high-volume static end points most requests will be satisfied directly from storage. Its storage backends expose a RESTful table storage API similar to Amazon DynamoDB and Google DataStore. The primary implementation uses Apache Cassandra. Notable features include automatically maintained secondary indexes and some lightweight transaction support. A SQLite backend is under development. RESTBase automatically emits statsd metrics about all storage and backend requests. This provides a good baseline level of performance and error instrumentation in a micro-service architecture.",
