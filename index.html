<p>I went all in with <a href="http://swagger.io/">Swagger, the machine readable API definition format</a> over a year ago, and since then I've been working to better understand the specification, and the tooling being built on top of it. To continue pushing forward my understand, as I do with all my other research, I've started a research project for Swagger via the API Evangelist network.</p>
<p>This approach to my research allows me to gather data, and slowly organize into a coherent view of the space, all along the way sharing with my readers, and the public at large. So far I'm tracking on these areas:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Platform Integrations -</strong> Companies who are using the Swagger specification as part of their platforms--essentially baking it in.</li>
<li><strong>External Integrations - </strong>Companies and individuals who have integrated Swagger into an existing platform, or framework, from the oustide-in.</li>
<li><strong>Swagger UI - </strong>API providers who are using Swagger UI as part of their API operations, providing interactive documentation to their consumers.</li>
</ul>
<p>It can be very difficult to understand what is happening when it comes to Swagger, even if you are as immersed in the API space as I am. Not everyone who is using it, is actively talking about what they are doing, and how the specification is put to use. There is also a lot of misconception about what is Swagger, and most people consider Swagger UI - Swagger.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next I'm going through the tooling I've found on Github, and trying to make sense of how people are using the specification, beyond the core areas like documentation, and code generation. As with all of my research, I am publishing all my research here on Github, for anyone to fork, contribute to, and evolve.</p>
